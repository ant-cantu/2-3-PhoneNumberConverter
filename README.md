# Phone Number Converter

## About Phone Number Converter

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created for the second lab of my class and
follows exactly what my professor asked to be designed. I am
limited on the methods and techniques I can use based on what we 
have covered in our class textbook.

The instructions were to create a tool which will conver a telephone
number to its corresponding text. Example: Cool Guy = 266-5489
